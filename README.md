# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# use cases of lock file

1. Maintain the package inside the project
2. Maintain the package count by npm
3. Maintain the consistency of patch/fix version across the development env

# Props

props in react component are analogous to inputs in function

Requirements for TODO app:

# As a user I want to:

1. Add todo

   Text field + add button

   Concept to understand:

   1. Two way binding of state

2. Delete Todo

3. Edit Todo
4. List todo by status (done, pending)
